## Divisible Sum Pairs
### Description

This algorithm takes an array of integers and a positive integer, k, and returns the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j and (a[i] + a[j]) is divisible by k.

The algorithm loops through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j and checks if the sum of the corresponding array elements is divisible by k. If it is, it increments the count variable. Finally, the function returns the count variable, which represents the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Usage

To use this algorithm, you can call the divisible_sum_pairs() function and pass in the following parameters:

n - the length of the input array
k - the positive integer to check for divisibility
ar - the array of integers

Here's an example of how to use the algorithm:
```
n = 6
k = 3
ar = [1, 3, 2, 6, 1, 2]

result = divisibleSumPairs(n, k, ar)
print(result)

```

This will output 5, which is the number of pairs in the array that satisfy the condition.

### Edge Cases

This algorithm takes into account several edge cases to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently under all possible input scenarios. Here are the edge cases that the algorithm factors in:

1. Empty array: If the input array is empty, the function returns 0.
Small input array: If the input array has only one or two elements, the function returns 0.

2. Large input values: If the input array contains very large values, the algorithm may run into issues with integer overflow
   
3. k = 1: If the input integer k is 1, every pair of elements in the array will satisfy the condition, so the function returns the total number of pairs (n choose 2) where n is the length of the array.
   
4. No pairs satisfy the condition: If there are no pairs in the array whose sum is divisible by k, the function returns 0.
   
5. All pairs satisfy the condition: If every pair in the array satisfies the condition, the function returns the total number of pairs (n choose 2) where n is the length of the array.
   
By taking into account these edge cases, we can ensure that the algorithm returns correct output and runs efficiently for all possible input scenarios.

### Time and space complexity

The time complexity of the Divisible Sum Pairs algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the algorithm uses nested loops to check all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), because it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input parameters and the count variable.

Note that while the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), the actual running time may be affected by the input values, including the size of the array and the magnitude of the values in the array. In particular, if the array contains very large values, the algorithm may run slower due to integer overflow.
