## Merge Sorted Arrays (In-Place)

This document describes an algorithm for merging two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, **in-place** within `nums1`.

### Problem

Given two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, both in non-decreasing order, and their respective sizes, `m` and `n`, merge them into a single sorted array stored **within** `nums1`. The final sorted array should remain in non-decreasing order.

### Algorithm

This algorithm uses a **two-pointer approach**:

1. **Initialize pointers:** 
    * `k`: Points to the current position in `nums1` where the merged element will be placed (starts at `m + n - 1`).
    * `i`: Points to the current element in `nums1` (starts at `m - 1`).
    * `j`: Points to the current element in `nums2` (starts at `n - 1`).
2. **Merge loop:** While `j` is greater than or equal to 0 (still elements in `nums2`):
    * **Compare elements:** Compare the elements pointed to by `i` and `j`.
    * **Place larger element:** If the element in `nums1` is larger (or both are equal), it means it's already in its correct position. Therefore, move `i` and `k` back by one each.
    * **Place smaller element:** Otherwise, if the element in `nums2` is smaller, place it at the current position (`k`) in `nums1`. Then, move `j` and `k` back by one each.
3. **Handle remaining elements:** After the loop finishes, if any elements remain in `nums1` (due to `m` being smaller than `n`), they are already sorted because they were initially non-decreasing.

### Complexity

* **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The algorithm only uses constant additional space for the three pointers (k, i, j).
* **Time Complexity:** O(m + n) - The algorithm iterates through both arrays at most once, leading to linear time complexity in the combined size of `m` and `n`.

### Benefits

* **In-place:** This algorithm modifies `nums1` directly, saving memory compared to creating a new array.
* **Efficient:** The algorithm runs in `O(m + n)` time complexity, making it efficient for large datasets.

### Applications

This algorithm can be used in various situations where merging sorted data is required, such as:

* Data analysis and visualization
* Sorting algorithms (merge sort)
* Implementing priority queues
* Combining multiple ordered streams of data
