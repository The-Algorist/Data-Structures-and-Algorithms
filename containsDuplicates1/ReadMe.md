## **Algorithm for Checking Duplicate Numbers in a List**

This README file explains an efficient algorithm for checking if a list of integers contains any duplicate elements. This can be useful for various tasks like data validation, detecting anomalies, or finding matching pairs.

**Problem:**

Given a list of integers `nums`, determine if there are any elements that appear more than once in the list.

**Solution:**

This algorithm utilizes a set to efficiently keep track of unique elements encountered while iterating through the list:

**1. Algorithm Description:**

* **Set Initialization:** An empty set named `seen` is created to hold the unique numbers encountered so far. Sets offer fast membership checks compared to other data structures like lists.
* **Iteration:** We iterate through each element of the list (`nums`) using a simple `for` loop.
* **Duplicate Check:** For each element (`num`), we check if it is already present in the `seen` set using the `in` operator. This is a constant-time operation on average.
    * If the element is present (`num in seen`), it indicates a duplicate and the function immediately returns `True`.
    * If the element is not seen before (`num not in seen`), it is added to the `seen` set using the `add` method to track it as unique.
* **No Duplicates:** If the iteration completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`, indicating all elements are unique.

**2. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The dominant cost comes from iterating through the list once and performing constant-time membership checks in the set.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) - Storing unique elements in the set requires space proportional to the size of the list.

**3. Benefits:**

* **Simplicity:** The algorithm is easy to understand and implement, utilizing basic Python constructs.
* **Efficiency:** Using a set for membership checks offers fast performance, with time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n).
* **Versatility:** This approach can be extended to check for duplicates within certain distance restrictions or apply to other data types besides integers.

**4. Example Usage:**

```python
from this_file import Solution

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5]
has_duplicates = Solution().containsDuplicate(nums)

if has_duplicates:
    print("List contains duplicates!")
else:
    print("List does not contain duplicates.")
```

This code demonstrates how to use the algorithm with a given list and check if it contains any duplicates.

**5. Further Considerations:**

* This implementation checks for any duplicates, regardless of their frequency. The algorithm can be adapted to find specific counts of duplicate occurrences.
* The use of a set assumes unique hashable elements. For non-hashable data types, alternative approaches might be required.

**6. Conclusion:**

This algorithm provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for checking duplicate elements in a list. Feel free to adapt and enhance the code for your specific needs and extend this documentation further if required.
